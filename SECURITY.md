## Out of Scope

While we appreciate all reports, the following are generally considered **out of scope** unless they pose a serious security risk:

- Bugs that require root/jailbroken devices
- Social engineering attacks on TradeVeil staff or users
- Physical attacks against infrastructure
- Volumetric Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks without proof of concept
