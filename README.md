## 🌍 The Problem

India's retail economy is expanding rapidly, but there's a huge digital disconnect in how retailers source products from wholesalers. Most existing platforms are either consumer-focused (like Flipkart, Amazon) or export-driven (like Alibaba), leaving a **gaping hole in the local B2B ecosystem**.

Platforms such as IndiaMART attempt to fill this gap but fall short due to:
- **Public pricing visibility**, hurting retailer profits and wholesaler privacy
- **Lack of strict verification**, allowing end customers to snoop into wholesale rates

This lack of privacy and focus makes current platforms ineffective for Indian wholesalers and small-to-medium retailers.

---

## 🔐 The TradeVeil Solution

**TradeVeil is a privacy-first, local B2B wholesale marketplace**, built to empower Indian wholesalers and retailers through secure digital infrastructure. 

Key goals:
- Facilitate **genuine B2B connections**
- Protect **price privacy and product data**
- Ensure only **verified users** can access the platform
- Streamline product discovery **based on business category**

Retailers can view only relevant categories. Wholesalers can list products without worrying about price exposure or customer leakage.

   - Ensures strategic protection and confidentiality

4. **Secure Communication Flow**

All submissions are manually verified by our **customer care/verification team**. Access is only granted upon approval, ensuring platform trust and security.

- Wholesalers get peace of mind that listings won’t reach unintended audiences
- No open browsing by general users or end customers
- Platform focuses only on B2B buyers and sellers

---

We keep it simple and sustainable:

### 1. Retailer Subscription
- ₹100/month OR ₹600–₹700/quarter
