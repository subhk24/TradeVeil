Project Vision
TradeVeil is dedicated to building a secure, private, and efficient digital marketplace that exclusively connects local wholesalers and retailers. Unlike platforms that expose prices to the public or directly serve end-customers, TradeVeil focuses on protecting the business interests and privacy of both wholesalers and retailers in the local market. Our mission is to foster trusted, profitable, and confidential relationships-ensuring that sensitive information like product prices and business details remain visible only to verified members.

Registration Process
For Wholesalers:

Registration is strictly based on GST number and business credentials (business name, email, etc.).

Only verified wholesalers can list product categories.

For Retailers:

Retailers must provide a GST number and select a business category (e.g., mobile shop, clothing, stationery).

Retailers can only view products and prices relevant to their chosen category, ensuring privacy and market segmentation.

For small shops without GST, alternative documents (such as shop bills, electricity bills, income tax returns, or shop license) must be submitted for manual verification by our team.
