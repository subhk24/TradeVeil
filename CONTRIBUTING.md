Project Vision
TradeVeil is dedicated to building a secure, private, and efficient digital marketplace that exclusively connects local wholesalers and retailers. Unlike platforms that expose prices to the public or directly serve end-customers, TradeVeil focuses on protecting the business interests and privacy of both wholesalers and retailers in the local market. Our mission is to foster trusted, profitable, and confidential relationships-ensuring that sensitive information like product prices and business details remain visible only to verified members.
