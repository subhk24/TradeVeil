Project Vision
TradeVeil is dedicated to building a secure, private, and efficient digital marketplace that exclusively connects local wholesalers and retailers. Unlike platforms that expose prices to the public or directly serve end-customers, TradeVeil focuses on protecting the business interests and privacy of both wholesalers and retailers in the local market. Our mission is to foster trusted, profitable, and confidential relationships-ensuring that sensitive information like product prices and business details remain visible only to verified members.

Registration Process
For Wholesalers:

Registration is strictly based on GST number and business credentials (business name, email, etc.).

Only verified wholesalers can list product categories.

For Retailers:

Retailers must provide a GST number and select a business category (e.g., mobile shop, clothing, stationery).

Retailers can only view products and prices relevant to their chosen category, ensuring privacy and market segmentation.

For small shops without GST, alternative documents (such as shop bills, electricity bills, income tax returns, or shop license) must be submitted for manual verification by our team.

Privacy & Access
General public cannot access product listings or prices.

Only verified wholesalers and retailers can interact on the platform.

Addresses are not shared until a deal is finalized; demo product delivery uses a pick-and-drop service to protect identities.

Each wholesaler and retailer sees only the information relevant to their business, maintaining confidentiality and competitive advantage.

Business Model
Premium Access: Retailers receive a three-month free trial, then can subscribe for ₹100/month or ₹600–₹700 for three months.

Wholesaler Fees: Wholesalers may be charged a commission based on sales or a fixed fee.

Integrated Revenue: Both premium subscriptions and sales-based commissions support platform sustainability.

Promotion & Unique Features
Three-month free trial for all users.

Demo product delivery: Retailers can try products before committing to bulk purchases, increasing trust and satisfaction.

Strong emphasis on privacy: Product prices and business details are never exposed to the public.

Active onboarding of wholesalers with assurances of data security and exclusive access to a verified retailer base.
